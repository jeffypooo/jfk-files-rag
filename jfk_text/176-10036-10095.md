SOURCE A VIETNAMESE OFFICIAL (F), WITH EXCELLENT CONTACTS AT THE PRESIDENCY.
APPR IT IS POSSIBLY TRUE THAT BOTH DIEM AND NHU HAVE BECOME AT LEAST PARTIALLY UPSET
OVER CERTAIN AMERICAN ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND OVER THE LARGE NUMBER OF
AMERICAN PERSONNEL CURRENTLY IN SOUTH VIETNAM.

1. BY MID-APRIL 1963 A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TENSION HAD
DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
OVER OPERATIONS IN SOUTH VIETNAM. BOTH DIEM AND NGO DINH NHU WERE
CONCERNED OVER RECENT "INFRINGEMENTS" OF VIETNAMESE SOVEREIGNTY.
MAAG WAS CITED AS A VIOLATOR IN THIS CONNECTION, BUT THE U.S.
SPECIAL FORCES WERE SINGLED OUT AS THE MAIN IRRITANT. DIEM IS
ALLOWING ADDITIONAL TIME FOR FURTHER BLUNDERS AND, AFTER BUILDING
UP A STRONG CASE, HE PLANS TO CONFRONT AMBASSADOR NOLTING AND
USMACV CHIEF GENERAL HARKINS WITH IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE OF U.S.
RESPONSIBILITY, DEMANDING A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF U.S.
