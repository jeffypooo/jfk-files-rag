from Chief, Central Cover Group concerning the threat of exposure of Agency operations and concludes that the BROWN Foundation of Houston, Texas was one of the most vulnerable to exposure because public records reflect direct ties from Agency funding instruments identified by Congressman PATMAN in 1964 to legitimate foundations and Agency projects they have sponsored.

VERNON FUND - $69000-573

The VERNON Fund (HEMUDWEED) was created by the Agency in June 1958 as an ostensibly private philanthropic foundation legally incorporated under the laws of and with an office in the District of Columbia. It is used as a cover and funding mechanism for Project DILAMPREY. The objectives of this project is the development of organizational and individual assets capable of strengthening the unity of non-Communist teachers and their organizations throughout the world. These objectives are carried out through the active support by the Agency of the International programs of the National Education Association (FBLINTERN) and the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession (JELACEPOD) with which NEA is affiliated. In March 1967 because of exposure of the Vernon Fund in news media, the Board members were contacted advised as follows:

Each Vernon Fund board member is being advised that he will receive a copy of the NEA and WCOTP letters regarding press allegations; he will acknowledge his membership on the Vernon Fund board if confronted with the facts he will acknowledge that the Vernon Fund has supported WCOTP and that it made a few small grants to NEA; he will decline any further comment on the origin or operation of the Vernon Fund, on sources of Vernon Fund money, on whether the Vernon Fund received money from the Agency, or any other aspect of the Fund; he will be informed that the Vernon Fund records are not available to the public, short of subpoena; he will be asked to return any files or papers relating to the Vernon Fund; he will be told that Dr. CARR (William George CARR) has not yet had to identify any board members but will probably have to; he will not comment on the creation of the Vernon Fund and how initial contacts were made.

DICK, Albert Blake, III - #0178333 (Vernon Fund Board Member)

World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Professions (Funded by the Vernon Fund)

I In April 1967 a discussion was held between an Agency representative and John THOMPSON and Ray GEMS of the WCOTP (World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Profession) concerning future funding for WCOTP. Because of publicity concerning the funding of WCOTP by the Vernon Fund, WCOTP leadership promised its membership that no further Vernon Fund money would be accepted until the status of the Vernon Fund was clarified. John THOMPSON felt that the best solution would be a one-time only infusion of money by sterile check into the WCOTP bank account to be backstopped by a letter from the attorney for the Vernon Fund, Bryce REA, who would attribute the money to members of the Vernon Fund Board who anonymously wished to provide WCOTP with sufficient funds to cover expenses until other sources could be found.

In May 1967 John THOMPSON of the WCOTP described to an Agency representative an interview he had with Mike MacMANUS of TIME magazine on 1 May 1967 who wanted to discuss the effects of newspaper publicity on WCOTP operations. MacMANUS was especially interested in any economies forced on WCOTP and a request for proof of the value of WCOTP operations to individual teachers. THOMPSON felt that MacMANUS did not succeed in gaining sufficient additional information from the interview to warrant writing his projected article.

SMYKE, Raymond Joseph - #160091
