1. BELIEVE IT CURRENTLY APPROPRIATE REVIEW AMFAUMA-25 SITUATION
VITHIN FRAMEWORK THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE REF
FORWARDED. SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE:

THUS DIRECT THREAT SECURITY AMFAUNA-35, AMFAUNA-39. BERNARDO
(ALVAREZ) NOW AND EDUARDO VEGA HAS BEEN ELIMINATED AS INITIAL
DEBRIEFING ABFAUNA-14 REVEALS THESE AGENTS NOT KNOWN DSE. WILL
ATTEMPT CONFIRM THIS INITIAL DEBRIEFING CONCLUSION VIA FLUTTER
EXAM. IT APPEARS HOWEVER THAT OUR REMEDIAL ACTION HAS NOT
ONLY AVERTED POSSIBLE FLAP BUT HAS KEPT VIABLE ASSETS IN PLACE.

B. WAVE ATTEMPTS EXFIL ANCUTLER-2 WERE NOT PRODUCTIVE
BECAUSE ARGUTLER-2 REFUSED LEAVE CUBA WHEN WE OFFERED HE. THIS
OPPORTUNITY. THIS DUE FACT HER MOTHER SERIOUSLY ILL.
MROVAL ARCUTLER-2 FROM CUBA STILL REMAINS PRIORITY TASK AS
AIFAUNA-14 DEBRIEFINGS CONFIRMS WAVE'S LIOUS ANALYSIS THAT
AMCUTLER-2 IS PRIME CANDIDATE FOR IMMEDIATE ARREST. HER ARREST
