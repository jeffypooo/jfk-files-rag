Amendment and Termination of Project
KDFACTOR
1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photo-
graphic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted
against the Soviet Embassy. Assets included five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of the KDFACTOR opera-
tions,
2. Agent termination was accomplished without any
imédiate difficulties; however, continued security will
depend on the terminated agents' silence. In the event
there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta-
tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be
minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR's
operations.

3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc-
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination
costs. This project action requests this additional:
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director
SUBJECT
For Operations
: Project KDFACTOR Amendment
and Termination Request.
1. The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in
1958 to provide financial and material support for
visual and photographic surveillance operations
targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites.
2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
ADDC in the amount of $19,000 for FY- 72 and
$20,000 for FY 73. Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment M. 1
to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
for FY 72 to provide for costs of agent
terminations.
3. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project.

4. The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down, the two basehouses under the project
was $1,412. The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
Although Amendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

SECRET

EINPOET CL DY 035022

SECRET
project, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the terms of each Memorandum of Oral
Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican
law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
was requested. Termination payments made to each
agent are as follows:

KDFACTOR-2
KDFACTOR-5
KDFACTOR-6
KDFACTOR-8
KDFACTOR-9
(Recruited 1956) $8,160
(Recruited 1956)
2,366
(Recruited 1956)
2,830
(Recruited 1965)
649
(Recruited 1966)
1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
KPFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with Mexican
law and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

5. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations. KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-5, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station. However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this
project.

7. It is also requested that the termination
of the KDFACTOR Project be approved effective 30
June 1972.

KDFACTOR - Mexico City, Mexico -- Photographic Surveillance
Team Support -- FY 1972, Cost $19,000 and FY 1973,
Cost $20,000

Fiscal Year Approved Obligated
1971 $23,635 $27,586

Changes:

1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, WES
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. KDFACTOR-1 wis
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the RED TOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce R. FERNALD. When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent
meetings.

Accomplishments:

1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-,
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens.
visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

-2-
These photographs and reports have contributed operational
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a nev, complete roster within a matter of weeks.

Costs:

1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and
$20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested
that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of
$4,260 to provide for the termination of KDFACTOR-1 and
KDFACTOR-7.

2. Source of Funds: Project KDFACTOR is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's Operational Program in the
amount of $23,735 for FY 1972 and $24,182 for FY 1973.
