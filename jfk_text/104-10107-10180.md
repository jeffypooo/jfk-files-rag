: Request for Services of Collins Modem Field Service
Engineer

1. The Office of Communications recently purchased two Colline Radio
Company Model TE-216D-160 High Frequency Data Modens at a cost of $20,000
each. These Hodems are specially designed equipment and will be used to
best the feasibility of transmitting Secure (encrypted) Voice over a narrow
band, high frequency, radio circuit. We also intend to determine their
suitability for use in high speed data transmission, and tests by our
Engineering Staff are scheduled to commence in mid-February.

2. Owing to the fact Modeas are very complex in operation requiring
special set-up techniques end adjustment, it would be adventageous to have
a specialist available to assist our personnel and to assure timely completion
of the tests. Accordingly, it is requested that a contract be let with the
Collins Fedio Company for the services of a Field Service Engineer. It is
presently estimated that the services of this Engineer will be required at
24 (Station "D", VTC) for approximately six to eight weeks depending on test
results. The exact date on which the Engineer is needed will be determined
as preliminary installation of the equipment is completed. For planning
purposes, however, ve estimate he will be required on or about 6 March 1967.

3. It is understood from discussions with Collins representatives at
Newport Beach, California, that engineering services of this type cost
approximately $3,000 per month in addition to travel expenses. We recommend
that the services of Moden Field Service Engineer, Mr. (Donald Warren Waycott,) 106
be secured, as he has an Agency TOP SECRET clearance effective 19 May 1965.

4. For any additional information, please contact Mr. (Jeck W. Andrews
on Extension 2045.
