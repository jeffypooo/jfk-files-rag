CONTACT REPORT #11. 25 Jarvary 1963.
TIME/PLACE : Safe House #2, 1000-Jan 25,
PRESENT : Tulpa, Tipteft, Lavton,

1. Purpose of this meeting was to inform Kulpa that
Headquarters had agreed to his trip to the Congo and to pay certain
instructions to Meinturff. L. said that he had not as yet received
instructions from Holden and that the latter planned to be in town on
Saturday. He would send the airline ticket from that city. L. also stated
that Serge Michel had agreed that the first six covers on the new trique
Revolutionaire (I) would be shot by K. K. his to fix up for a light master
since he said that his present one was broken and since he had to take
pictures prior to his departure for the Congo which he anticipated would be
either early or mid next week.

2. Another twist was that he had been contacted by Gibson,
who informed him that a certain Dave watts who runs a highly suspect sheet in
New York City had written to Gibson asking him for photos; Gibson will
purchase and forward several of K.'s negatives. Since all this is
rough, Kulpa promised to get more facts.

3. The rest of the meeting was taken up by Tipteft
straightening out his accountings.

4. Next meeting. 1000 Tuesday 29 Jan.
