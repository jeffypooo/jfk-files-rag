2. At the request of the SENIOR CIA OFFICER prefixed the operational briefing with a brief description of how the U. S. Intelligence community operates, of the role of CIA, of the need for compartmentation and security, and specifically of how the foregoing considerations make it imperative for (the Guatemalans) to adopt security precautions which will ensure that the information we provide and the joint operations we undertake are compartmented within the Guatemalen government (and, in fact, discussed by the Guatemalan government exclusively with our representatives in the fisia).

3. Following the introductory remarks outlined above, I briefed the group on the DGI structure, the DGI operational techniques, and specifically on DGI aims and operations in Guatemala. The (president)lent close attention throughout the briefing and examined the exhibits closely, including the DGI intelligence requirements for (Guatemala) and the (Salvadoran "Caso Zapato" file).

in this connection! asked for close cooperation and coordination of activities, promising that we shall do our utmost and making reference to our travel lists and watch list.

8. At the conclusion of the meeting, (Peralta) asked for a copy of the requirements (which he already had gone over closely) and took the copy with him to study further.

5. With reference to (Dalton's) case, because of the developments and plans in (El Salvador), I explained briefly the status of the (DALTON card)and the possibility of his being transferred to Guatemala). (This was in line with the discussion that occurred in (El Salvador) which included our officer, the Crealdent and the President's intelligence advisor, Colonel MEDRANO). In that the Guatemalan government take no action unless requested by President RIVERA or Colonel MEDRANO and that, if (DALTON) is transferred, one of our people probably would talk to (DALTONs) in (Guatemala)).

a. His own long experience in the OAS, in Cuba and in Central America;

b. His early warnings about Castro--which were disregarded;

c. The extent to which Guatemala has lived up to its obligations in the OAS; to which it has cooperated in efforts against Castro; and to which it has looked toward U.S. leadership;

d. The failure of the U. S. to take aggressive action against Cuba and the need for taking a hard line, including the use of force in support of military activity by the free Cubans and the other American countries;

e. His appreciation that the Soviets will not be willing to risk a nuclear war over Cuba;

f. Condemnation of Mexico for her dealings with Cuba, for failure to abide by her obligations in the OAS, and for permitting the Castroites to operate out of Mexico against other American countries;
