1. Reference A does not give sufficient detail to make a very
realistic appraisal at this time of the damage to our operations from
the arrest of ANIC 3-1 24

2. According to ANIC 1-1, the head principal Agent of our stay-
behind nets in Cuba, ANIC 3-1 was fully informed of everything
concerning operations and reporting. He also knew of the APCORT-1
agent net and how contact can be made with the agents. He was kept
fully cognisent of all incoming and outgoing radio messages and
reports.

3. Following is a list of the agents known or probably known
to ANIC 3-1:
   a) ANRYE-1

5. ANIC 3-1 was also made aware of the persons with whom
the staybehind funds are cached or stashed. He seems to have provided
1.01.24 (T-34 with a radio set on a Korch 1941.) We did know one of the
staybehind agents (who was originally introduced to the British.)
