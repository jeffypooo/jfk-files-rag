POST NOMINAL BOND. IMMINENT RELEASE EXPECTED. JUMUD-13

I SAID HE THOUGHT HE COULD ARREST GOMEZ AGAIN 15 DAYS AFTER RELEASE AND HOLD HIM IN JAIL OVER WEEKEND TO ALLOW STATION TO MAKE RECRUITMENT PITCH. JURUD-13, HOWEVER, NOT VERY DEFINITE IN HIS OFFER AND SINCE HE HAS NOT BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENT IN THE PAST, STATION PREFERS COMPLETELY UNILATERAL PITCH. AS SOON AS GOMEZ IS RELEASED AND RELOCATED, WE WILL REQUEST AMMUG-1 PRESENCE SAN SALVADOR TO MAKE UNILATERAL PITCH. IF IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO FALL BACK ON JOINT RECRUITMENT PITCH IN JAIL, ARNUG-1'S SERVICES WILL STILL BE NEEDED.
