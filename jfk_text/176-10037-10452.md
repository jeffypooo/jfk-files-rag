ה
11 FIELD COMMENT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THE INFORMATION PROCEEDED
FROM A SINGLE -SOURCE OR FROM TWO SOURCES AND THE VARIATION IN DETAIL WAS IN THE
ORAL ACCOUNTS OF DIFFERENT SOURCES THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCES ORGANIZATION (CIO) WAS UNAWARE OF ANY POSSIBLE COUP SHORTLY AFTER
MIDNIGHTON 1-2 AUGUST. HOWEVER, AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME, THE NORMAL
PRESIDENTIAL GUARD HAD ALREADY BEEN REINFORCED AND POLICE CHECK POINTS ALSO
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN REINFORCED. GIVEN THE ADVANCE LALERT BY THE GUN MILITARY
AND SECURITY ELEMENTS, JAIT IS PROBABLE PROBABLE THAT ANY INTENDED INTENDED COUPL COUP WOULD BE ABORTIVE
FIELD COMMENT
