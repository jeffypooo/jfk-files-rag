MEMORANDUM POR: James S. Woods
FROM
SUBJECTI
John N. McMahon
Deputy Director for Operations
Commendation for Exceptional Performance
1. The Directorate of Operations Records Review
Task Force has finished its work in Warrenton. I want
you to know that I realize that a large measure of the
success of this effort was due to the exceptional per-
formance of the Records Management Officers who worked
long and hard during the six-month period, patiently
guiding the 435 Directorate personnel who served on
the component teams. Many of you performed additional
duties, voluntarily and cheerfully, extending beyond
the ten-hour work day, which kept the task force
functioning smoothly.
2.
This fine team effort and your personal
contribution to it is in the best tradition of the
Directorate of Operations. I commend you for a job
well done.
